You are given a positive integer. Your function should calculate the product of the digits excluding any zeroes.

For example: The number given is 123405. The result will be 1*2*3*4*5=120 (don't forget to exclude zeroes).

Input: A positive integer.

Output: The product of the digits as an integer.

Example:

1 checkio(123405) == 120
2 checkio(999) == 729
3 checkio(1000) == 1
4 checkio(1111) == 1

How it is used: This task can teach you how to solve a problem with simple data type conversion.

Precondition: 0 < number < 106
